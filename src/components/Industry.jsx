              VASTR ensures that all royalties are paid instantly upon a stream.
              Artists, producers, and labels can avoid cash flow delays,
              receiving their share of royalties in real-time as soon as a
              customer engages with their content.

              <br />
              Our proprietary system works with whatever business model you may
              have in place. Your clients maintain control of their per-stream
              rates while our infrastructure handles the revenue sharing. A
              streamlined transaction fee applies—your platform retains 10% of
              each transaction, VASTR receives 10% for providing the licensing
              infrastructure. The Marketplace of origin takes a fee, and the
              remaining amount goes to the artist.

            <p>
              Asset owners create licenses that work for their business model by
              choosing between exclusive or non-exclusive distribution. With
              VASTR, copyright owners can customize every aspect of their
              licenses—from stream rate to availability. This allows owners to
              maintain complete control over how their music is distributed and
              monetized.
